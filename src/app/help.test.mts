/**
 * The help centre (MK-2, 9 Oct 2026) describes the product, so it goes stale
 * the way every second copy of a fact in this tree has: the product moves and
 * the description does not. Four things are held here, none of which reads
 * the build, so none skips on an unbuilt tree.
 *
 * 1. **Every number in the copy is the code's.** config/help.ts interpolates
 *    each figure it states - the cluster and prompt counts, the sign-in
 *    lifetimes, the team caps, the Google depth, the prices, the notice
 *    period - from the module that enforces it. A figure typed into a
 *    sentence, in digits or in words, is a copy that will not follow the
 *    code, so none is allowed. The only digits in the copy are inside `ui()`
 *    labels, which rule 2 holds to the product instead.
 * 2. **Every control the copy names is one the dashboard draws.** A sentence
 *    saying "choose Cancel trial" is wrong the day the button is renamed, and
 *    nothing else would notice. Each literal `ui("...")` label must be drawn
 *    by the dashboard's own code: a string literal of exactly those words, or
 *    JSX text, with comments cut first. Reading raw text let a doc comment
 *    that names a control stand in for the control (review of MK-2, 9 Oct
 *    2026: "Cancel trial" renamed in Settings.tsx stayed found in limits.ts's
 *    header), the cut source-read.mts records being paid for seven times.
 * 3. **The copy is built for the trial's state.** config/trial.ts turns the
 *    free trial off in one line, and every reader takes `enabled`; the help
 *    is built off here and must not name a trial.
 * 4. **Every article is a page, and every page is offered**: one page file per
 *    article and none spare, each in sitemap.ts and the footer reaching the
 *    index. sitemap.test.mts checks the sitemap against the built pages, and
 *    skips on an unbuilt tree; this half does not skip.
 *
 * And one decision: the help promises no reply time. Danny reversed the one
 * promise of that kind (R24, 26 Sep 2026), and putting one back is his.
 *
 * What it cannot see: whether a sentence without a number or a control name
 * is still true. Those were checked by reading the code on 9 Oct 2026 and are
 * recorded in config/help.ts's header. The help's two promises that answers
 * are kept are reading-retention.test.mts's, with every other surface's.
