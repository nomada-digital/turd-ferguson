/**
 * Whether today's alwaystracked runs were all read, for an uptime monitor
 * (9 Oct 2026, audit reliability-6, spec OP-1).
 *
 * 200 until 07:00 UTC whatever the runs are doing, then 503 for the rest of
 * the London day if any client that should have been read has no complete or
 * partial run - failed, stalled, never claimed, not dispatched, or no run at
 * all (run-health.ts healthAnswer). A monitor that knows only status codes
 * alerts on the 503; the summary mail to our own inbox says which client and
 * why, and /admin/tracking can re-run it. 503 too when the runs cannot be
 * read, which is the check itself being down.
 *
 * Read-only: it sends nothing and writes nothing, so a crawler or a stranger
 * polling it costs a few database reads and no vendor call (spend-gates,
 * paid-get). No secret, no client and no count in the answer: the day, the
 * deadline, whether it was met, and the names of the states unread clients
 * are in (run-health.ts healthAnswer; counts said how many clients there
 * are, so they are on /admin/tracking only).
