/**
 * Invite, change a role, remove - R142 part 2 (1 Oct 2026; BRIEF-4 P2 Team).
 * Posted by plain HTML forms on Settings, so it works with JS off; the answer
 * is a 303 back to the page with the toast in the URL. Session and membership
 * as the stop route; owners only. The rules are team.ts; the invite mail is
 * invite-mail.ts. The fixture is read-only unless TRACKING_FIXTURE_WRITE=1
 * (R168), which holds the change in memory; on the fixture nothing is sent.
 *
 * AG-1 (9 Oct 2026): every rule runs on the members who see this client, and
 * the invite is to this client only or to every client on the account
 * (scope.ts). The rules are team.ts planTeam, which this route and the
 * fixture both call with the account's whole live team; the route reads and
 * writes, and decides nothing itself (team.test.mts pins it).
