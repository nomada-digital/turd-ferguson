/**
 * "Do not have time to wait? We will email it to you." - Danny, item 5, and his
 * own idea.
 *
 * Offered while a scan is reading. It is not a speed fix: **it converts a
 * bounce into a captured address.** Everybody who gives up at ninety seconds is
 * lost silently today, and the visitor who takes this offer is the one already
 * on their way out.
 *
 * All this route does is put the address on the scan row. The message is sent
 * by `sendRequestedReport`, from whichever of two places notices the pass is
 * finished - normally the pipeline, at the moment it writes the completed
 * status. **That is what makes leaving safe**: the pass is server-side and has
 * never cared about the tab, so the address only needed somewhere to live that
 * outlives the browser.
 *
 * ## POST only, and why that matters here
 *
 * This route puts a message on Resend's bill, so it is one of the doors
 * `spenders.mts` walks for and `paid-get.test.mts` asks about. `robots.txt`
 * closes `/scan/` and not every query shape, so a spending GET is every crawler
 * on the internet spending. There is no GET export.
 *
 * ## What bounds it
 *
 * **One message per scan, ever**, and the bound is not here - it is the
 * compare-and-swap inside `sendRequestedReport`, which stamps
 * `report_email_sent_at` and reads the address back out of what it stamped. So
 * this route can be posted a hundred times and the hundred posts write one
 * column; the number of messages is the number of scans that asked, and scans
 * are bounded by the four ceilings in front of every door that starts one.
 *
 * **And a cooldown per caller**, added 20 September 2026 with Danny's decision
 * that this send needs no verification step. His words: "an unverified address
 * is a send endpoint anybody can point at a stranger... without it this is a
 * form that mails arbitrary people on request." One address per scan was
 * already true; what was missing was anything at all across scans, and the
 * per-scan bound does nothing against a caller holding several tokens.
 *
 * The caller is hashed with `hashIp`, the same function `ip_scans_per_day`
 * counts under, and stamped on the row as `report_email_ip_hash` in the same
 * write that takes the address. **Not read back off `scans.ip_hash`**, which is
 * whoever started the scan: the 30-day domain cache hands one visitor another
 * visitor's completed scan and token without inserting a row, so the caller
 * this limit most wants to find has no `ip_hash` row of their own anywhere.
 * Stamping it here is what makes the count follow whoever asked for a message.
 *
 * The refusal is a 429 and it fails **closed** - a cooldown read that errors
 * refuses. `ceilings.ts` records why in its own header: a guard whose read did
 * not answer used to be a guard that was simply off. The cost of the wrong
 * refusal here is a visitor waiting fifteen minutes for a copy of a page that
 * is already on their screen.
 *
 * ## Why a disposable address is accepted here and refused by the unlock
 *
 * The unlock refuses them, and should: there the address is the *price* of the
 * gated report, and a throwaway address buys it with nothing. Here the address
 * is not a price. The free result is free, it is already on the visitor's
 * screen, and they are asking for a copy of what they can see - so refusing
 * would deny somebody the thing they asked for, for a lead-quality reason that
 * does not apply to this door. Deliberate; do not "tidy" the two into
 * agreement, and do not copy that list into this file to do it.
