 * Stripe's webhook (BRIEF-3 C4, R92/R110/R117, 30 Sep 2026). Registered in
 * Stripe for checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated and
 * customer.subscription.deleted; customer.subscription.trial_will_end is
 * handled from 8 Oct 2026 (trial_ending's fallback) and invoice.payment_failed
 * from 9 Oct 2026 (BL-2, the owner's past-due banner), and each is acted on
 * once the endpoint is subscribed to it in the Stripe Dashboard. The raw body is verified against
 * STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET before it is parsed; unset, the door answers 503 and
 * acts on nothing. The event id goes into stripe_events first, so a replay is
 * a 200 that does nothing. The rules are in lib/checkout/webhook.ts, the
 * writes in lib/checkout/signup.ts.
