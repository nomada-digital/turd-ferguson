/**
 * Every **route** in this tree that can cause somebody to be billed, and what
 * stands in front of each one.
 *
 * That word is load-bearing and it was not here originally. This file said
 * "every door in this tree" and then walked `src/app/api` for `route.ts`,
 * which is a claim wider than its own denominator - the defect it was written
 * to catch, in itself. **Two `"use server"` actions bill Resend on an
 * anonymous post and are neither under `src/app/api` nor named `route.ts`**, so
 * this walk cannot see either of them however the lists below are edited.
 * `src/app/mail-doors.test.mts` is that half, and it derives its own set by
 * walking for `"use server"` rather than by naming the two.
 *
 * `ceilings.test.mts` now executes the ceilings themselves. That is one way
 * down a two-way street: it proves the guard decides correctly and says nothing
 * about which doors have it. Three routes call `checkCeilings`; **eight can
 * cause a paid call**, and the five that do not are each bounded by something
 * else entirely - a per-scan reservation, a compare-and-swap, a dollar cap read
 * somewhere else, a send ceiling counted in a database function. Not one of
 * those pairings was written down anywhere, so the
 * denominator was invisible: a new route that spends would have been in nobody's
 * list, passed tsc, passed the build, passed every test and passed the deploy.
 *
 * This is the same shape as `readiness.ts` before `d0898cf` - correct about
 * every key it named, while `SCAN_FROM_EMAIL` was read by four senders and on
 * no list at all. A census belongs in a test, not a comment.
 *
 * ## What is asserted, and why each part has to be here
 *
 * 1. **The set of spending routes is pinned.** A route that starts calling a
 *    paid entry point fails this file until somebody classifies it. That is the
 *    whole point: the failure is meant to be a question, not a bug report.
 * 2. **Every spending route is guarded or exempt, and every exemption names its
 *    own bound in its own source.** A written list that is merely a list rots
 *    into a blanket pass - `public-routes.test.mts` learned that. So each
 *    exemption is re-earned here by finding the thing it claims bounds it.
 * 3. **The kill switch's reach is measured, not assumed.** `scans_enabled` is
 *    documented in `settings-merge.ts` as the switch thrown in a hurry "by
 *    someone who will not then go and check that it took". It reaches three of
 *    the eight doors. That gap is real, it is Danny's call rather than mine
 *    (docs/blocked.md), and pinning it here means it cannot widen silently
 *    while the question is open.
 *
 * ## The honest limit of reading this as source
 *
 * A route "spends" if its own source calls one of the paid entry points below,
 * or imports a vendor client directly. That cannot see a paid call reached
 * through a module the route imports for another reason - which is exactly why
 * the import-graph version of this check was discarded: it reported `/full` and
 * `/opportunities` as spenders because something in their graph imports
 * `anthropic.ts`, when both only read rows that were already paid for. An
 * import is not a call. The named-entry-point list is narrower and true, and
 * the direct-import assertion below is what stops a route routing around it.
 *
 * ## The third vendor, and why the denominator left this file
 *
 * `VENDORS` was typed here, and its own comment called them "the two clients
 * that actually put a request on the wire to a vendor". There are three.
 * **Resend bills per message**, which is the premise `mail-doors.test.mts` is
 * built on and which blocked.md 24 states in as many words, and the module
 * that sends was not on this list because whoever wrote it was thinking about
 * the scan pipeline. So `/api/scan/[token]/resend` - under `src/app/api`,
 * named `route.ts`, squarely inside this walk, and existing only to put a
 * second message on a vendor's bill - passed tsc, the build, this file and the
 * deploy while appearing in neither list here.
 *
 * That is this file's own species caught in this file for the second time. The
 * first was the header, which claimed "every door" over a walk that could only
 * see routes; this was a typed denominator *inside* a rule, written from the
 * instances in front of whoever wrote it.
 *
 * The fix is not a longer list. `paid-get.test.mts` was answering the same
 * question two files away with a denominator of its own, derived off the two
 * *guard* names, and could see five of the eight - it missed
 * `scan/[token]/confirm`, which runs the whole free pass. **Two copies of one
 * denominator, each blind somewhere the other was not.** So the set moved to
 * `spenders.mts`, a helper both import, and its header carries the whole
 * measurement. What stays here is the question this file asks: what stands in
 * front of each door.
 *
 * `mail-doors.test.mts` still does not merge in, for the reason it gives: it
 * asks what bounds the *rate* a stranger can open a door, this asks whether a
 * door reaches `checkCeilings`. A route appearing in both is correct. What
 * would be wrong is a door appearing in neither, which is what just happened.

   *
   * **Six since 20 September 2026, and the sixth does not move the decision.**
   * `scan/[token]/email-report` records an address for a scan that is already
   * running and paid for, and sends one message per row for the life of that
   * row. `scans_enabled` stops new scans; refusing this one would strand a
   * visitor mid-scan to save nothing, which is the same reading the resend door
   * got when it joined this list a few hours earlier.
   *
   * What the count is for is that a door cannot join quietly, and this one
   * tried: it reached its vendor one hop away and was green in this sweep and
   * in `paid-get` until `sendRequestedReport` was named in `spenders.mts`.

     * Seven earlier on 24 Sep 2026 - the walkthrough alert, which mails only

     *
     * The three that went are the email gate's: `scan/[token]/unlock`,
     * `verify/[vtoken]` and `scan/[token]/resend`. Their routes were deleted,
     * so these are not doors that were closed, they are doors that stopped
     * existing. The open question shrinks with them, and the biggest single
     * spender on the whole list - the gated pass behind `completeUnlock` -
     * is the one that went.
     *
     * Five on 28 Sep 2026: `walkthrough`, the tier pages' ask with no scan -
     * one Resend message to our own inbox, like its scan-keyed sibling above.
     * `scans_enabled` stops new scans; this starts none, so the switch has
     * nothing to refuse here and the decision is not moved.
     *
     * Seven on 29 Sep 2026: `cron/track` and `track/run`, the daily tracking
     * runner (T1). Deliberately outside `scans_enabled`: that switch stops
     * visitors' scans, and a client's paid tracking has its own switch,
     * `tracking_enabled`, plus its own dollar cap - both in refuseRun.
     *
     * Eight the same day: `app/login`, the dashboard login link (T3). One
     * message to a member we already hold; `scans_enabled` stops scans and
     * this starts none.
     *
     * Nine on 30 Sep 2026: `app/[client]/check`, Check keyword in Add a
     * cluster (BRIEF-3 T6 part 3b). Two DataForSEO reads for a signed-in
     * member, bounded per client per day; it starts no scan, so
     * `scans_enabled` has nothing to refuse.
     *
     * Ten the same day: `app/[client]/ask`, a member's ask (BRIEF-2 T11). One
     * Resend message to us or the account's agency contact, three a member a
     * day; it starts no scan, so the decision is not moved.
     *
     * Eleven on 1 Oct 2026: `app/[client]/member`, an owner's team invite
     * (R142 part 2, BRIEF-4 P2). One Resend message to the address invited,
     * twenty an owner a day; it starts no scan, so the decision is not moved.
     *
     * Twelve on 2 Oct 2026: `app/[client]/setup`, setup confirmed (R166 step
     * 4). One Resend message to us, once a client; it starts no scan, so the
     * decision is not moved.
