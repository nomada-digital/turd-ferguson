/**
 * The join between a `fetch` and the route that answers it, in both
 * directions. Nothing in this tree had ever read it.
 *
 * `paid-get.test.mts` proves no route that spends money answers GET. That is
 * one way down a two-way street: it is correct about every route it names and
 * says nothing about whether the routes that MUST answer a POST still do.
 * `cron-schedule.test.mts` is the same shape - it proves every cron route
 * refuses a wrong bearer, and nothing proves the right one is accepted. This
 * file takes the direction neither of them looks in.
 *
 * The gap is real and it is silent at every gate this repo has. A route path
 * is built by string concatenation at the call site - `"/api/scan/" + token +
 * "/unlock"` - so **no type connects a caller to the route it calls**. Rename
 * the directory, drop the `POST` export, change the method on one side only,
 * and `npx tsc --noEmit` passes, `npm run build` passes, every existing test
 * passes, and the deploy is green. What breaks is a 405 inside a submit
 * handler on a conversion path, visible to nobody but the visitor who clicked.
 *
 * Both directions are checked:
 *
 *   FORWARD - every internal `fetch` in the tree names a route that exists and
 *   exports the method it uses. This is the one that catches a dead button.
 *
 *   REVERSE - every route method that exists has a caller, or a written
 *   exemption with a reason. A route nobody calls is either dead code or a
 *   caller that was deleted; both are worth a sentence. The exemptions are
 *   re-earned below rather than trusted, and checked for staleness, so the
 *   list cannot rot into a blanket pass.
 *
 * What this cannot do, said out loud rather than left for somebody to discover:
 * a concatenated path collapses its dynamic segment to `*`, so
 * `"/api/scan/" + p.token` matches both `/api/scan/[token]` and
 * `/api/scan/start`. A call resolves if ANY route matching its shape exports
 * the method. That is weaker than naming one route, and it is the honest limit
 * of reading a template literal as source - it still catches a renamed
 * directory, a dropped export and a method changed on one side.
