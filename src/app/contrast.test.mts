/**
 * What every coloured string on this site is actually sitting on.
 *
 * ## Why this could not be done before, and why it can be now
 *
 * blocked.md 9 is the contrast decision, and it says the measurement "depends
 * on what the element is sitting on, and only a rendered page knows that -
 * which is why a source read never caught it and a browser did". The first
 * half is right and the second half is not. A source read cannot do it,
 * because a call site says `color: T.soft` and says nothing about the ground.
 * **The built bytes can**: every ground on this site is a `background` on an
 * ancestor's inline style, so the answer is in the HTML, one tag stack away.
 *
 * That matters beyond tidiness. The browser measurement behind blocked.md 9
 * read **two pages** - the homepage and one blog post - and extrapolated the
 * rest from the chrome. This reads all 31 swept states and every element on
 * them, which is how the count in that entry went from "43 on the homepage,
 * 26 on a post" to the exact figure now recorded there.
 *
 * ## What holds the property that is already fixed
 *
 * `37512ae` moved 46 sites from `faint` to `soft` BY HAND, because `faint` is
 * 2.54 on white and `tokens.ts` says in its own doc comment that light-ground
 * text does not use it. Nothing held that. A sweep pointed at the token would
 * have been decoration - there is no live instance, every `faint` in the
 * shipped bytes is on a dark ground at 6.99:1 or better - but the same walk
 * that proves it also judges every other colour on the site, and four of those
 * pairs do fail. So the rule is stated over the whole palette rather than over
 * one token, and it fails on a 27th pair rather than on a name somebody
 * thought of.
 *
 * ## What it cannot see, stated plainly
 *
 * - **A colour set by the stylesheet.** This walk reads inline styles, which
 *   is where this site puts nearly everything. `globals.css` sets a colour in
 *   six rules and they are pinned by the last test here, with a reason each,
 *   because a rule that cannot resolve them should say which ones it is
 *   passing over rather than pass over them quietly.
 * - **A gradient.** `.btn-primary` is white on a purple gradient, so its label
 *   has no single ground - it has a range. That is measured in the last test
 *   and it is the one place on the site where the answer is worse than the
 *   inline sweep can see: blocked.md 31.
 * - **Opacity.** The motion from-state rests at `.15`, which no reader ever
 *   sees at rest, and the failsafe bounds it - `motion-rest-state.test.mts`
 *   holds that and it is not a contrast question.
 * - **An image behind text.** There is none; `page-head.test.mts` asserts
 *   there is no `<img>` on the site at all.

 * allowance the next failure inherits.

 * re-earned below - so a value that changes fails here rather than quietly
 * surviving its own answer. Same device as `mail-from.test.mts` asserting the
