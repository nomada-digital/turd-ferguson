 * Written as "White-labelled, from $99 a month." rather than opening the
 * sentence on the price, because `priceProse` returns the label's own casing
 * and this tier's label carries a leading "from". Capitalising it here would
 * be a second decision about the string; moving the clause is none.
 *
 * 8 Oct 2026, LB1: "White-labelled" is withheld until the dashboard carries
 * the agency's brand (`dashboardBranding`), so the price moved up beside the
 * product's name rather than being lost with it - the same words, reordered.
 * "For one topic" went: the plan is sold as TRACKED_CLUSTERS clusters.
 * Coverage matching, the host article's Google position and white-label
 * reports are not built for this tier, so every line claiming them sits behind
 * its capability in `config/capabilities.ts` (`coverageUpload`,
 * `hostArticleRankings`, `reportBranding`) and comes back in these words when
 * it ships.
