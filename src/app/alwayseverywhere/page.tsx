/**
 * Pricing spec 27 Sep 2026, section 8: alwayseverywhere is brand PR and earned
 * media on top of the alwayscited plan, not a portfolio of clients. Sold to
 * brands direct rather than white-labelled (open decision 5's default, Danny to
 * confirm). The spec's claims rules hold here harder than anywhere: no
 * guarantee of mentions, citations or coverage on this tier, and no price.
 *
 * 8 Oct 2026, LB1: "This tier is not white-labelled." is true, but stressing
 * "this tier" contrasts it with tiers that are, and no tier's dashboard
 * carries an agency's brand yet. It waits on `dashboardBranding` with the
 * "are white-label" lines it answers; the tile reads whole without it.
