/**
 * The privacy policy - Legal.dc.html.
 *
 * Every factual claim here is one I checked in the code rather than one the
 * board asserted:
 *  - raw IPs are never stored, they are salted SHA-256 (lib/scan/ip.ts)
 *  - nothing is purged: what each engine said is kept for as long as the scan
 *    is, and the nightly job clears nothing (api/cron/purge-responses).
 *    Danny's decision, 24 September 2026. The response_retention_days row is
 *    still in app_settings and nothing reads it
 *  - the only third-party script the browser loads is Cloudflare Turnstile
 *  - the app sets no cookies of its own: no document.cookie, no cookies()
 *  - there is no analytics of any kind installed
 *
 * All five are executable now, and a claim on this page that is not executable
 * is a claim that rots: `analytics-claim.test.mts` holds the analytics one,
 * `privacy-claims.test.mts` holds the other four. Read those before rewording
 * anything below - they fail on the wording as well as on the code,
 * deliberately, so a reworded promise cannot quietly outrun what enforces it.
 *
 * The board's processor list omits Anthropic, which the scan sends crawled
 * site text and the generated questions to. It is listed here. It also omitted
 * Cloudflare, and that one was found by executing the claim above rather than
 * by reading: `verifyTurnstile` posts `remoteip: ip` to Cloudflare's siteverify
 * endpoint on all three scan doors, so the raw address - the thing "What we
 * collect" promises is never written down - does leave this server, to a
 * processor the page did not name. Never stored and never disclosed are
 * different promises and the page was only keeping the first.
 *
 * Where a clause needs a fact nobody has given me, it is left out rather than
 * guessed. The company name and number are Danny's (26 Sep 2026, R31,
 * COMPANY_LINE; the address came off on 28 Sep, R81); the ICO number is
 * still open. The page carries no
 * drafting markers (Q22, 26 Sep 2026); every open gap is in
 * docs/blocked.md instead.
 */


/**
 * The five documents the board's sidebar switches between. Four are not
 * drafted anywhere - terms of service, a standalone cookie policy, a data
 * processing agreement and a sub-processor list - and Danny's answer on
 * 19 Sep was that the legal facts wait. They are listed as unpublished
 * rather than linked or hidden, because a reader looking for terms should
 * find out they do not exist rather than assume they missed them.

        When you run a scan we store the domain you entered. If you ask for a walkthrough or a demo, or ask us to email
        the result to you while the scan is still running, we store the email address you gave, and nothing else about
        you. We do not
        ask for a name, a company, a phone number or a card. The contact form collects what you type into it. We also
        store a salted one-way hash of your IP address, to stop one visitor running the scan hundreds of times - the
        address itself is never written down, and the hash cannot be turned back into it.

        The email address exists so we can send you the link back to your report, and so a scan can be reclaimed if
        nobody opens it. An address given to have the result emailed is used for that one message and creates no
        account. An address given for a walkthrough or a demo is passed to Danny at nomada digital, who uses it to send
        you the video or arrange the call. Our lawful basis is legitimate interest in responding to a request you made. We do not add you to a
        mailing list, because there is not one.

        Scan results are kept indefinitely, so you can come back to the link, and so is what each engine said. We used
        to delete the text after seven days on a scan nobody claimed; we do not any more. It is the evidence behind every figure in
        your report, and a number you cannot read back to the words that produced it is not evidence. On a tracked account, every daily
        answer is kept for the life of the account, and you can download it from the dashboard. The dashboard also records which of
        its features are used - which page was opened, which control was pressed - to improve it; it stores ids and counts, never what you type.

        The scan runs through DataForSEO, which queries the engines on our behalf - your domain and the generated
        questions pass through it, your email address does not. Anthropic reads the text of the site being scanned and
        writes the questions. Cloudflare runs the robot check in front of a scan, and we pass it your IP address so it
        can do that. Email is sent through Resend. Hosting is Vercel, and the database is Supabase, in London. To
        say how hard each placement on a report would be to land, we look up the cited sites&apos; domains on a
        link marketplace - only those domains, nothing about you.

        This site sets no cookies of its own, with one exception: when a client signs in to their <TierName tier="tracked" />{" "}
        dashboard, we set one login cookie so they stay signed in. It holds a random key and nothing else, lasts 30
        days, is cleared when they log out, and is never set on any other visit. The site runs no third-party analytics - there is
        no Google Analytics, no tag manager, and no advertising pixel. The dashboard's feature counts, described above, are
        our own and go to no third party. The one third-party script the page loads is Cloudflare Turnstile, which checks you are not
        a robot before a scan runs - usually without showing anything - and it sets storage of its own to do that.
