/**
 * Every door in this tree that puts a message on Resend, and what bounds how
 * often a stranger can open it.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists rather than another entry in spend-gates
 *
 * `spend-gates.test.mts` opens by claiming to hold "every door in this tree
 * that can cause somebody to be billed". It then walks `src/app/api` for files
 * named `route.ts`. That claim is bigger than that walk, and the gap is not
 * hypothetical: **two of the three things in this repo that bill Resend are
 * `"use server"` actions, and neither is under `src/app/api` nor named
 * `route.ts`.** They are registered POST endpoints in production all the same -
 * Next builds an action id for every export of a `"use server"` module that a
 * client component imports, and both of these are imported by a mounted client
 * component. So there are two anonymous doors onto a vendor bill that passed
 * tsc, the build, every test and the deploy while being in nobody's list.
 *
 * This is the same species that file was written for and the same one
 * `readiness.ts` was before `d0898cf`: correct about every name it carries,
 * with the defect sitting outside its denominator. The fix is the same too -
 * the census goes in a test, and the census derives its own denominator by
 * walking rather than by being typed.
 *
 * The two files are deliberately not merged. `spend-gates` classifies a door by
 * whether it reaches `checkCeilings`, which is a scan-pipeline question and
 * says nothing at all about mail; this one classifies by what bounds the rate.
 * What keeps them from drifting into two lists that disagree is that neither
 * types its own set: each walks for its own vendor and fails when the walk
 * finds something it cannot name.
 *
 * ## What is asserted
 *
 * 1. **The set of modules that can send mail is derived, not typed.** A new
 *    sender fails this file until somebody says what bounds it.
 * 2. **The set of server actions is derived too**, because that is the half
 *    `spend-gates` structurally cannot see, and it is where both of the
 *    anonymous doors are.
 * 3. **Every bound is re-earned from the source that claims it**, the
 *    `evidence` pattern `spend-gates` uses - a written list that is merely a
 *    list rots into a blanket pass.
 * 4. **The rate gap is pinned as an assertion, not described in prose.** Two
 *    doors take an anonymous post and send a message with no per-caller
 *    identity of any kind. That is Danny's call (docs/blocked.md) and this
 *    means the answer arrives as a deliberate edit here rather than by drift.

 * door without this, and the harness proves it by adding one and asserting the
 * sweep stays green.
 *
 * Where it is **not**, and the first version of this comment said it was:
 * `config/contact.ts` discusses `"use server"` twice in prose, but the action
 * walk anchors to the start of a line with only whitespace in front, and those

 * routes that only read rows already paid for.
