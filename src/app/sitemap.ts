/**
 * The sitemap.
 *
 * Every entry used to carry `lastModified: new Date()`, which made all 21
 * URLs report the moment of the build. Today that happens to be true - the
 * whole site was rebuilt on 19 September - and from tomorrow it is a lie that
 * repeats on every deploy. A lastmod that always says "just now" is not a
 * weak signal, it is a discarded one: a crawler that finds the field
 * unreliable stops reading it for the whole site, and this is a site whose
 * product is being read accurately by crawlers.
 *
 * So the dates are literals. Three of the four blog entries show an edit date
 * rather than their April publication date because their copy was edited then
 * - lastmod is the last change, not the byline.
 *
 * The rule, for whoever edits a page next: change the copy on a route,
 * change its date here. A date that is stale by a week says less than one
 * that is wrong by four months, and far more than one that is always now.
 *
 * **That rule went stale in under 24 hours.** Written on 19 September with all
 * 21 entries dated that day; by the morning of the 20th, 19 of the 21 routes
 * had a page file with a newer commit against it and not one date here had
 * moved. So read the list below as maintained by hand and therefore behind,
 * not as measured.
 *
 * Two things were tried and rejected before leaving it hand-written:
 *
 *  - **Deriving lastmod from `git log` on the route's own page file.** Wrong
 *    in both directions at once. It is blind to copy that lives in a shared
 *    component - the tier lockups in `PackagePage` change four package pages
 *    and touch none of their files - and it fires on presentational churn,
 *    because a motion sweep that adds `ac-row` to every page on the site would
 *    bump all 21 dates without a word of copy changing. A field that moves on
 *    every deploy is the `new Date()` failure again, arrived at slowly.
 *  - **Deriving it from the rendered HTML.** Right in principle and it needs a
 *    committed hash manifest plus a test that regenerates it, because there is
 *    no `.git` on Vercel at build time. Worth doing; not done.
 *
 * What IS enforced is the set, in `sitemap.test.mts`: these URLs must be
 * exactly the canonical URLs the site declares indexable, both directions, and
 * none of them may be a path `robots.ts` closes. That closes the silent half -
 * a new page never reaching the sitemap at all - and leaves only the dates
 * approximate. `sitemap.test.mts` deliberately does not check lastmod, for the
 * reasons above; do not "fix" that by wiring it to `git log`.
