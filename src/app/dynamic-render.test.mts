/**
 * The sweeps' own blind spot, made into a thing that fails.
 *
 * Until this file existed, every sweep in the tree walked `.next/server/app`
 * for `*.html` and called the result "the site". It is not: a route marked `ƒ`
 * in the build output writes no HTML there. `/blog`, `/scan`, `/scan/[token]`,
 * `/coverage-check/[token]` and `/admin/scans` were all outside every check
 * recorded as cleared - and `/scan` is the funnel's entry point.
 *
 * The danger in the fix is that it fails open. `capture()` writes files; if it
 * is not run, `sweptPages()` quietly returns the prerender alone and every
 * sweep goes back to being blind while still reporting itself clear. That is
 * the *same* defect, so the check for it lives here, in one place, and says
 * what to run.
