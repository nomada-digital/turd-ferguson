/**
 * Where Stripe returns a buyer (R91, pricing spec section 5). It reads
 * nothing: the Session id in the URL is not looked up, so the page does not
 * claim the payment went through - Stripe's receipt does that. The
 * onboarding call is booked by reply until a booking flow exists (pricing.ts:
 * one destination for every CTA), so the page says who writes and where.
 *
 * R148 pass 8 (1 Oct 2026): an order carrying a scan (from=scan, set in
 * session.ts) has its dashboard built by the webhook, which emails the owner
 * a sign-in link (signup.ts). The page said only "the onboarding call", so a
 * buyer had no sign it existed and no way to it. Those orders now name the
 * link and get one way on, /app/login, which sends a fresh one. plan and from
 * only choose copy; anyone can type them, and nothing is written.
 *
 * R166 (1 Oct 2026, danny.md line 175): the one read. A dashboard order's
 * Session id is looked up in orders for its email, so the page can say
 * "Check <email>" and offer "Send it again". Still not a payment claim, and a
 * missing row (webhook not landed yet) keeps the old wording.
