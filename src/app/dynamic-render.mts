/**
 * Renders the routes `next build` does not prerender, so the sweeps can see
 * them.
 *
 * Every sweep in this tree walks `.next/server/app` for `*.html`. That set is
 * the *statically prerendered* pages, not the site: a route marked `ƒ` in the
 * build output has no file there at all. So `/blog` served the motion script
 * and `data-motion="on"` with zero motion classes for as long as it has
 * existed, and the motion census, the rows-inside-rows test, the tier-lockup
 * sweep and the href/h1/title/canonical/og sweeps all reported themselves
 * clear over a set that did not contain it. Every "all 22 pages" claim in the
 * worklog is true and narrower than it reads.
 *
 * The fix is not a list of dynamic routes typed here. That is this repo's own
 * defect species - a fixed rung against a list that can grow - and it would go
 * stale the first time somebody adds a route that reads `searchParams`. So the
 * unswept set is *derived*: every app page route in the build manifest that
 * did not get an `.html`. A new dynamic route joins the sweeps by existing.
 *
 * What still has to be declared is what a route needs in order to render at
 * all - a concrete value for a `[token]` segment, or the admission that it
 * needs a database this machine does not have. `STATES` holds that, and a
 * route missing from it is a hard failure rather than a silent omission.

 * - **Stripped to nothing, not to a space.** A price is three elements -

 *   reads "from $99/mo" as "from $99 /mo". The same fact makes `TierName` read
 *   as two words, which cost `structured-data.test.mts` a false positive: the
 *   lockup sets the accent half in a nested span, so a strip that spaces
 *   elements apart splits a tier name into its stem and its accent and no
 *   sweep looking for the word can find it.
 * - **Scripts go entirely.** The JSON-LD carries the price and the tier names
 *   too, in one contiguous string, inside a `<script>` in the body. Stripping
 *   tags but keeping their contents lets the structured data answer for the
 *   visible card - so a claim could vanish off the page a buyer reads and a
 *   sweep would still pass, off the copy an engine reads.
 * - **Comments go before the tags do.** A JSX comment survives into the markup
 *   as `<!-- -->`, and React separates adjacent text nodes with one, so a
 *   sentence built by interpolation arrives split. Stripping comments after
 *   tags leaves the `--` behind in the text.

 * punctuation. **A list does not.** `/compare`'s table and `/alwaystracked`'s
 * includes list carry no full stop until the paragraph after them, so the whole
 * table arrives as one run - and a run that long pairs any two words on the
 * page with each other. A rule asking whether one sentence says two things

/** Attribute values arrive escaped - React writes an apostrophe as `&#x27;`,
 *  which splits "client's" into two tokens and would let an entity hide a word
 *  a rule is looking for. The five named entities plus numeric escapes are the
 *  whole set React emits into an attribute.
 *
 *  Exported because the escaping is asymmetric across the two machine-readable
 *  surfaces and that asymmetry has already produced a false reading here: a
 *  head attribute is entity-escaped and a JSON-LD string is not, so comparing
 *  the two raw reports `og:description` and a schema `description` as different
 *  when the source types one literal. This is the existing cut rather than a
 *  new one - a stripper that differs in one case blinds the sweep that trusted
 *  it, which is why the private copies elsewhere stay private and this one is
 *  shared instead of retyped. */
