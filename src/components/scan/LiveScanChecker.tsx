/**

 * run, the result and the report. That split is the flow boards - the confirm
 * step alone is a fourteen-row table, which was never going to live inside a
 * 400px column in the hero - and it means a reload, a second device or the
 * link in the email all land on the same scan rather than an empty form.
 *
 * A cached complete scan goes to the same place. The token is the scan.
 *
 * `box` draws it as a page's own scan card - /seo-agencies, /how-it-works and
 * the case study - in that card's wording, instead of the hero field (R181,
 * 2 Oct 2026). Those cards were GETs to /scan because a second instance of
 * this component would have duplicated its field's id; the ids now come from
 * useId, so the card starts the scan where it is and goes straight on to
 * /scan/[token]. The card is still a GET form to /scan, so with no JavaScript
 * it lands on /scan with the domain filled in, as before.
