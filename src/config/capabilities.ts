/**
 * What the product does today, for the copy that would claim it.
 *
 * LB1 of the go-to-market audit (8 Oct 2026, every claim checked by two or
 * three adversarial verifiers): the live site sold an agency a white-label
 * dashboard, white-label reports, its own domain, coverage upload, Google
 * positions for the host article and consolidated invoicing. The product did
 * none of them, and nothing joined the copy to the code - `/white-label`'s
 * table was the site's record of who brands what, and nothing checked the
 * table against the product.
 *
 * So each capability is one flag here, false until the feature ships, and
 * every line of copy that claims one is written inside `listIf` or `onlyIf`
 * naming the flag it needs. While the flag is false the line is withheld; the
 * day the feature ships, flipping the flag restores every line at once, in
 * the words it had. `capability-claims.test.mts` fails when copy claims a
 * capability that is off - in the source outside its gate, always, and on a
 * built page after `npm run build` and `npm run capture`.
 *
 * Flipping a flag is a claim to a buyer. Do it in the commit that ships the
 * feature, with the evidence, and move the dated record in
 * `capability-claims.test.mts` in the same commit.
 *
 * No imports, so a `.mts` census can load this file as it is.
