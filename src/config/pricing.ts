/**
 * Which tiers a visitor can read a price for, and which are a call.

 * Derived here because four surfaces asserted the answer by hand and all four
 * were wrong. `/how-it-works` said "Every price is published, from tracking
 * alone up to alwayseverywhere" - naming, as the top of the published range,
 * the one tier whose `priceLabel` is "Book a call". The closing CTA on that
 * page and on /what-is-aeo said the same thing twice over, the 404 page's tier
 * link said "Four tiers, every price published on the page", and
 * /what-is-aeo's pricing FAQ opened "Ours are published rather than quoted."
 *
 * What makes it the expensive kind of wrong is that the site already says the
 * opposite, correctly, on the tier's own page: /alwayseverywhere explains that
 * the number of brands and markets changes the work "so we quote it rather
 * than post a figure we would have to renegotiate". A buyer could read both
 * sentences on one visit.
 *
 * Two readers of `basePrice` already understand this and neither was joined to
 * the copy: `priceProse` returns null for a tier with no number, and
 * `PackagePage`'s `serviceSchema` emits no Offer node for one. The copy is the
 * third reader and it was typed. It is derived now, so the day
 * `alwayseverywhere` gets a figure the sentences correct themselves rather
 * than a test asking somebody to.
 *
 * `basePrice === null` is the same test those two make. `isPriceLabel` in
 * price-label.ts answers the neighbouring question - whether the LABEL is a
 * price, which is what decides the type size - and `price-claims.test.mts`
 * holds the two in agreement rather than letting this file pick one.
