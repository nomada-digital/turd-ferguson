/**
 * The address on the envelope of every message this product sends.
 *
 * `email-header.test.mts` already walks every `emails.send` in the tree - it
 * was written for exactly this denominator, after `contact.test.mts` was found
 * to be right about every assertion while reading one file. It reads **one of
 * the five fields**: the subject. `replyTo` is guarded by `isPlausibleEmail`,
 * whose `[^\s@]` idiom makes a header terminator unreachable, so wrapping it
 * would be a guard with no effect and this repo deletes those. `from` and
 * `to` were read by nothing at all.
 *
 * Take a check that is right about everything it names and ask what it is not
 * looking at. It was looking at four subjects and not at four From lines -
 * and not at four recipients, which is the refill at the bottom of this file
 * and the more serious of the two.
 *
 * **What it found.** `process.env.SCAN_FROM_EMAIL ?? "alwayscited
 * <onboarding@resend.dev>"`, typed verbatim four times in three files - the
 * contact action, the waitlist action, and both sends in `verify-email.ts`.
 * `config/mail-from.ts` holds it once now, for the reasons in its own header.
 *
 * **What was watching it, and why that was not reading it.**
 * `readiness.test.mts` asserted `senders.length >= 3` over files containing
 * the string `SCAN_FROM_EMAIL`. Every word of that was true and it justified
 * the variable's place on the readiness list. It could not notice a sender
 * dropping off - a floor of three over four - and it never looked at the
 * value. That assertion is narrowed to "exactly one module reads it" in the
 * same push, because the other half is here.
 *
 * **Two directions, because a one-way check is this repo's recurring defect.**
 * Nothing else may type the literal or read the variable; and every send in
 * the tree must take its `from` from the one reader. The first alone passes a
 * tree where a fifth sender hardcodes a different address; the second alone
 * passes a tree where the module exists and three copies remain beside it.
 *
 * **What this cannot see.** Whether the address is one we own, or whether
 * mail from it is delivered. That is blocked.md 20 and a statement about a
 * vendor, and no source inside this repo settles it. What it does do is make
 * the absence executable: the fallback domain is asserted to still be
 * `resend.dev`, so the day it moves to a domain we own this fails and the
 * blocked item has to be closed rather than quietly outliving its answer -
 * the same device `organization-entity.test.mts` uses for the missing
 * `sameAs`.
 *
 * Proved against twelve injections (`docs/inject-mail-from.mjs`), 12/12, two
 * of them green-expected. The green cases are not decoration: the first of them
 * caught this push's own defect, a `readiness.test.mts` census reading raw
 * source and reporting a doc comment as a reader. The fifth-send case is what
 * earns the list below over a floor, and it had to be injected as an ADDED
 * send rather than a removed one - removing a call means removing a block,
 * and a half-removed call is a build failure, which is not a caught defect.

 * whether this product mails a stranger, and **AGENTS.md puts contacting
 * anyone on the absolute list** - above "ship it rough", alongside
 * credentials and destructive DDL.
 *
 * It was asserted nowhere. The property is written down three times in prose
 * - blocked.md 24 ("Both anonymous doors send to `CONTACT_EMAIL_DESTINATION`,
 * so neither can be used to mail somebody else from us"), the queue, and
 * `mail-doors.test.mts`'s own header - and `mail-doors` walks modules,
 * bounds, honeypots and the action manifest without ever reading a
 * recipient. A stated reason for a safety property is a claim about the tree
 * and it costs a `holds` now; that is the lesson `349dcda` left.
 *
 * **The defect it refuses is one word.** `waitlist.ts` has a stranger's
 * address in scope on the line above its send, as `replyTo: email`. Typing
 * it into `to` instead turns an anonymous, captcha-free, unrate-limited POST
 * into something that mails an arbitrary address from our domain. Nothing in
 * this tree noticed that before.
 *
 * Per call, not per file, for the reason `email-header.test.mts` records
 * about this exact file: `verify-email.ts` has two sends, so a rule satisfied
 * by "the right recipient appears somewhere in this module" is satisfied by
 * the correct send while the one beside it addresses somebody else.
