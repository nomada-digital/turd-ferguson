/**
 * The help centre (MK-2, 9 Oct 2026): what an alwaystracked buyer needs to
 * answer "why is this 27%?" or "why is today partial?" without writing to us.
 *
 * Every sentence here was checked against the code that does the thing on
 * 9 Oct 2026, and the facts it states are read from that code rather than
 * typed: the limits from limits.ts and team.ts, the sign-in lifetimes from
 * session.ts, the engines from pricing.ts and engines.ts, the prices from
 * pricing.ts, the trial from trial.ts, the partial sentence from run-note.ts.
 * A number in the copy below is always an interpolation. `help.test.mts`
 * holds that, and holds every control the copy names in bold (`ui`) to a
 * label the product really draws, so a renamed button fails there rather
 * than leaving the help describing a screen that no longer exists.
 *
 * Deliberately not here:
 * - a reply time. Danny reversed the one promise of that kind (R24, 26 Sep
 *   2026), so "Still stuck?" names where to write and nothing about when;
 * - agency mode. It is set per account by us, nothing public offers it, and
 *   the dashboard still carries our mark in it (`dashboardBranding` is false
 *   in config/capabilities.ts), so describing it would be a new offer. The
 *   one sentence an agency client needs - billing is handled by your account
 *   contact - is said where the dashboard says it;
 * - when the check runs. The cron is a schedule, not a promise; the help says
 *   where the dashboard shows the time a check finished, as the UI does.
 *
 * Copy is plain text, so the same strings serve the page head (where tier
 * names stay plain) and the body (where HelpShell renders them through
 * TierText). Two marks only: `[label](href)` is a link, `**label**` is a
 * control the dashboard draws, written through `ui()`.
