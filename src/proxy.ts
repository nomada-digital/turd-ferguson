 * NextResponse.next() for everything else. That is what lets it ship before
 * the domain exists.
 *
 * With APP_HOST set there are three rules, and they are all about one thing -
 * one address per page:
 *
 *   on the app host   `/tallyroo/clusters` renders `/app/tallyroo/clusters`
 *                     and `/app/tallyroo/clusters` 308s to the clean form,
 *                     because bookmarks and already-sent emails carry it
 *   on the app host   /admin is a 404. The operations page stays on the main
 *                     host, where its Basic auth is
 *   on the main host  `/app/...` 308s to the app host, path and query intact
 *
 * The matcher below runs this on every request that is not a static asset,
 * which is wider than the /admin-only matcher it replaces. It has to be: the
 * rewrite applies to paths that carry no prefix of their own, so there is no
 * pattern short of "everything" that catches them. Each request costs one
 * host comparison when APP_HOST is unset.

/**
 * No matcher, deliberately.
 *
 * `/admin/:path*` was the matcher until 6 Oct 2026, and a path pattern is all

 * the documented `/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image).*)` form compiles to
 * something that matches nothing here and the proxy silently stops running -
 * no error, no warning, just a middleware that never fires. Checked by
 * setting a header on every response and watching it never arrive.
 *
 * Host routing has to see paths that carry no prefix of their own
 * (`/tallyroo` on the dashboard's host), so there is no path pattern short of
 * everything. Without a config export the proxy runs on every request,
 * including static files, and the first thing it does is hand the static ones
 * straight back. *
 * How this version finds and bundles the file (8 Oct 2026, Next 16.3.5,
 * read off a build rather than assumed): src/proxy.ts becomes the function
 * `/_middleware` in .next/server/functions-config-manifest.json with
 * `"runtime": "nodejs"` - the Edge middleware-manifest.json stays empty. With
 * no config export its matcher is `/:path*`, compiled to `^.*$`, so it runs
 * on every path; proved on `next start` by a temporary header that arrived on
 * all twelve paths checked, /_next/static and /api included. The code is in
 * .next/server/chunks/; .next/server/middleware.js is a 221-byte Turbopack
 * loader stub, which is why grepping it for this file's strings found none.
