/**
 * Which client a Stripe subscription's event is about, and the payment step
 * it writes (BL-2, 9 Oct 2026). Moved out of signup.ts on review of 2c6dc99,
 * with relative imports only, so the handler itself runs under node --test
 * against a stand-in database (subscription-events.test.mts).
 *
 * The review found the subscription's client was taken from its scan token
 * first: the newest client_domains row made from that scan, whoever's it
 * was. Nothing stops two accounts buying one scan, and Nomada makes clients
 * from scans by hand (admin/tracking/actions.ts) with no subscription at all.
 * So a failed renewal on one account's subscription put its Stripe invoice
 * page - the buyer's name, email, address and amount - on another account's
 * banner, and an unpaid one ended a client someone else was paying for.
 * Before BL-2 the same mix-up moved only cluster_limit and a cancellation.
 *
 * Now the order row decides. orders.stripe_subscription_id is written by the
 * Checkout Session that made the subscription, with the client that Session
 * made (signup.ts writeOrder). Only a subscription no order row names falls
 * back to its scan, and then only to the one client from that scan that no
 * other subscription's order bought; anything less certain is no client. A
 * client found that way is `exact: false`: it keeps what it had before BL-2
 * (packs, a trial's end, a cancellation's end), and gets no payment step and
 * no trial email. Payment state, invoice links and payment ends are written
 * only to a client an order row ties to the subscription.
