/**
 * Payment state (BL-2, 9 Oct 2026): what a client's Stripe subscription says
 * about being paid, and what the webhook does with it. Pure, so every rule is
 * tested with recorded payloads and never a live call; signup.ts does the
 * reads and writes, into the columns 20261009030000_payment_state.sql adds.
 *
 * Before this, customer.subscription.updated rewrote only cluster_limit and
 * trial_ends_at, and the runner dispatches every client whose status is
 * active (runner.ts dispatchTrackingRuns). A card that failed for good left
 * the client tracked every day at our cost, and its owner was never told.
 *
 * - past_due: Stripe is still retrying. Tracking carries on and the owner
 *   sees a banner with what to do (tracking/plan-banner.ts).
 * - unpaid, paused, incomplete_expired: Stripe has stopped trying, or never
 *   will. The client ends, as a cancellation ends it - nothing is deleted -
 *   and payment_ended_at says why. incomplete_expired is not in the BL-2
 *   spec's list: it is the one other status in which Stripe never charges
 *   the subscription again.
 * - canceled: the client ends through the same path as
 *   customer.subscription.deleted (signup.ts endClient), whichever of the two
 *   events arrives first.
 * - active or trialing again: the failure is over. A client ended for payment
 *   is made active again; one ended any other way stays ended.
 *
 * Stripe does not promise to deliver events in order, so each write carries
 * the event's own `created` time and is made only over an older one
 * (newerThanRecorded): an unpaid that arrives after the payment that cleared
 * it ends nobody.
