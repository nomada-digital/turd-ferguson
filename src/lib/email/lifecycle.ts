 * approves that preview.

 * block (book a call, email us); the company line in the footer. Receipts,
 * VAT invoices and failed payments are Stripe's, so none of them is here.

 * in its place; trial_midpoint and trial_ending go from the daily cron
 * (lifecycle-sweep.ts), picked by lifecycle-schedule.ts. Each names the moment
 * the trial ends in the client's zone (trialMoment), what is charged then
 * (trialCharge) and where to cancel. Each has its own flag, off.
