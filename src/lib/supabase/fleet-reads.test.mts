/**
 * No read of a tracking table across every client is left to one page.
 *
 * PostgREST answers a select with at most db-max-rows rows - 1000 on a
 * default project - and says so nowhere (page.ts). The tracking tables grow
 * with every client and every day, and on 9 Oct 2026 (audit reliability-2)
 * two reads took them whole: the daily dispatch read every unstopped prompt
 * of every client in one select to decide who to run, and /admin/tracking read
 * every client's prompts, keywords and runs the same way. Past a thousand
 * rows, clients beyond the cut counted no live prompt, were skipped and got
 * no run, and the admin counts went wrong with them - nothing errored. Both
 * are paged now; this keeps the next one from arriving unpaged.
 *
 * A select of one of these tables must be bounded by what it reads, in one of
 * five ways, each read off its own chain:
 *
 * - **paged** - `.range(`, as `selectAll` and every paged read here call it;
 * - **counted** - `head: true`, which returns no rows;
 * - **limited** - `.limit(`, `.single()` or `.maybeSingle()`;
 * - **one client, run, cluster or row** - `.eq(` on client_domain_id, run_id,
 *   cluster_id, question_id or id. A client's rows are bounded by its
 *   allowance (limits.ts) and a day's by its prompts and engines, so these
 *   are not the read that grows with the fleet. `.in("client_domain_id", ...)`
 *   is not one of them: it is every client named;
 * - or written down in FLEET_UNPAGED with why it is safe. It is empty.
 *
 * What this cannot see: a table named by a variable (limits.ts `liveCount`
 * takes it as an argument, and counts with head: true), and a builder handed
 * on before its select (overview-data.ts passes `db.from("tracking_answers")`
 * to read-shape.ts, which pages it). Neither is a select on the chain it is
 * found on, so neither is counted, and the floor below is what notices this
 * walk going blind.
