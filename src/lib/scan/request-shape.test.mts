/**
 * The module this tree spends the most money through had no executor until

 *
 * It said "the only module in this tree that spends money" until later that
 * day, and that was false three ways over: `anthropic.ts` bills per model
 * call, and Resend bills per message through three senders. The sentence is
 * corrected rather than deleted because it is the same wrong premise that left
 * `scan/[token]/resend` outside both spend sweeps - see `spenders.mts`. **The
 * denominator of "what spends" is bigger than the scan pipeline**, and a
 * comment that says otherwise is how it stays that way.
 *
 * `dataforseo.ts` is `server-only`, so Node's runner cannot load it, and it was
 * one of the source files named by no test - swept for text by the four walking
 * sweeps, with nothing anywhere running the behaviour. Its pure half is now
 * `dataforseo-request.ts` and this file runs it.
 *
 * Nothing here retypes a request body to compare against. Every expectation is
 * derived: the engine list off `ENGINES`, the location codes off `MARKETS`, the
 * country codes off `MARKET_ISO`, the depth off `SERP_DEPTH`. A test that
 * duplicates the value it is checking is true by construction - this repo has
 * shipped four of those - so what is asserted here is the *shape*, and the one
 * place a literal appears it is read back out of the source file rather than
 * typed.

 * message** - the shape the engine-count sweep already has. What is asserted is
 * that nothing in the shipped tree reaches this endpoint again, never that
 * today's diff deleted some lines. The endpoint PATH is the thing named,
 * because a path is what survives a reintroduction under a different function
 * name, and a different function name is exactly how a removal comes back.
 *
 * Read over the whole of `src` rather than over `scan/`: the door it would
 * return through need not be in the same directory. Comments stripped first -
 * the two doc comments recording this removal both name the endpoint, and a
