 * `@/lib/supabase/admin`, so Node's own runner cannot load it. The only way to
 * check the merge from there was to retype it in the test, which is the blind
 * tripwire this repo has now found four of - a test that validates a copy of

 * which is the arithmetic of a sentence written when the two kinds were one

 * `Object.keys(SETTINGS_FALLBACK).filter(k => typeof ... === "number")`, so a

 * closed
 * on a negative - `spentToday >= -5` refuses everything - but
 * `domain_cache_days` fails the other way, putting the cache window in the
 * future so every scan misses it and runs for real.
 *
 * The upper bound is not tidiness. `start/route.ts` builds the cache window as
 * `new Date(Date.now() - domain_cache_days * 86_400_000).toISOString()`, and a
 * value large enough to overflow that multiplication makes an Invalid Date,
 * whose `toISOString()` throws `RangeError` - uncaught, in the route that
 * starts every scan on the site. A typo with too many zeroes in a jsonb cell
 * should not be able to take the scan path down.

 * and the two look identical in the cell. Every number here survived that

 * booleans did not, and they are the two that matter:
 *
 * - `scans_enabled` as the string "false" is truthy, so the kill switch reads
