 * carried was wrong in both halves. Read that file: the SDK's own `maxRetries`
 * defaults to 2, so one `withRetry` call is up to nine requests rather than
 * three, and the SDK obeys a `retry-after` header with no ceiling of ours.
 *
 * What is worth keeping here is which of these five calls it protects and how
 * they differ. `generateQuestions` is the one a visitor is waiting on on the
 * first screen of the funnel, so a failure costs the scan outright. The three
 * batched calls that run after every engine read has already been paid for -
 * brand extraction, brand judgement and source classification - sit inside a
 * never-fatal catch, so a 529 in one of them does not fail the scan the way it
 * would there. It quietly shortens the leaderboard or the placement list,
 * which is the failure worth retrying hardest rather than the one worth
 * retrying least.
 *
 * The cost is bounded by the run, not by the arithmetic here: the batch count
 * scales with what the engines gave back (`CLASSIFY_BATCH` is 50 and the header
 * over it sizes a 400-source scan at eight batches), and each failed one costs
 * the SDK's backoff plus 5.5s. What holds it is `RUN_TIMEOUT` and the platform
 * cap above it, which is the ladder `run-steps.ts` records.

 * Pull the competitor set out of the Overview prose. Publications, directories

 *
 * Takes the answers as separate blocks rather than one joined string so the
 * batching can fall between two answers instead of through the middle of one.
 * Duplicate names across batches are not merged here - the caller already
 * merges on brandKey, which folds case and punctuation, and two normalisers
 * that disagree is how a leaderboard grows a second row for one company.
 *
 * `failedBlocks` (8 Oct 2026, audit reliability-1 / data-6): the indices into
 * `blocks` whose batch failed, so a caller can retry those answers and mark
 * the ones still unread rather than store them as naming no one - the daily
 * tracking runner read only `brands` and `calls`, so a 529 on one engine's
 * batch shortened every rival's count and raised the client's share of voice
 * on a run marked complete. `error` is the first failure's reason, for the
 * caller's error line.
 *
 * `options.signal` aborts a request in flight and stops the next one from
 * going out, and an aborted batch fails like any other. It does NOT cut short
 * a wait between the SDK's own retries: `retryRequest` sleeps out a
 * `retry-after` with no signal (retry-policy.ts), and so does `withRetry`. So
 * the signal alone is no deadline; a caller that needs one stops waiting on
 * this call when the signal fires (decide.ts extractWithRetry does).
 * `options.billed` is the counter the requests are tallied on, live, so a
 * caller that stopped waiting still knows what went out; `calls` is what this
 * call added to it.
