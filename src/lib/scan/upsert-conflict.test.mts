/**
 * Every `onConflict` names a column set some migration actually declares
 * unique - and every upsert names one at all.
 *
 * **Nothing connects the two ends.** `onConflict` is a string in TypeScript
 * and the constraint is DDL in a `.sql` file; no type, no import and no build
 * step reads both. Renaming a column, adding a fifth column to a composite
 * key, or writing an upsert against a table whose unique index was never
 * created all pass `tsc`, pass the build, pass every other test and deploy.
 * Same shape as `route-callers.test.mts`, where the path between a fetch and
 * the route answering it is built by concatenation.
 *
 * **What it costs when it is wrong.** Postgres answers an unmatched
 * `on conflict` with *there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the
 * ON CONFLICT specification* - it does not insert, it raises. In
 * `sources.ts` that raise happens on the last line, *after* the model calls
 * have been made and billed, and `pipeline.ts` wraps that call in
 * never-fatal. So the failure mode is: the scan pays Anthropic for every
 * source classification, throws the results away, logs one swallowed line,
 * and ships a report with nothing sorted. That is the silent-failure species
 * this repo keeps finding, with a bill attached.
 *
 * All four sites are correct today. This test exists so that stays a fact
 * rather than a coincidence, and it is written to fail loudly if it ever
 * stops being able to see - a sweep that quietly finds zero upserts is the
 * blind-tripwire recipe, so the denominators are asserted first.
