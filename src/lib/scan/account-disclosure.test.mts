/**
 * `account_id` never reaches a visitor.
 *
 * ## Why this is a claim about the code and not a tidiness rule
 *
 * `unlock.ts` records a real defect it fixed: `resolveAccount` matched a
 * stored address with `ilike`, which takes a SQL LIKE pattern. An underscore
 * matches any single character, so a stored `a_b@x.com` matched anything
 * submitted as `aXb@x.com` **and handed that visitor the other person's
 * account row**. Percent and asterisk are wildcards on the same path, all
 * three are legal in an address, and all three pass the route's regex - so it
 * needed no malformed input, an underscore was enough.
 *
 * The fix is `eq` on a lowercased address. What matters here is the sentence
 * that classifies what happened before the fix:
 *
 * > Nothing reads account_id back to a visitor today, so what this produced
 * > was wrong attribution rather than disclosure [...] It stops being only
 * > attribution the day there is an account view.
 *
 * That sentence is the whole difference between a mis-filed row and one
 * visitor being handed another's account identifier. **It was true, and it was
 * held by nothing** - the file names its own trigger ("the day there is an
 * account view") and has no way to notice that day arriving. A stated reason
 * for a safety property is a claim about the tree, and it costs a `holds` now,
 * the same device `organization-entity.test.mts` uses for the `sameAs`
 * absence and `mail-from.test.mts` uses to stop blocked.md 20 outliving its
 * answer.
 *
 * ## The mechanism, which is what rules 1 and 2 are actually about
 *
 * Nothing redacts anything here. `account_id` stays off the wire for one
 * reason only: **every read in this tree names its columns**, and the three
 * that name `account_id` happen to sit in routes that answer with a redirect
 * or with a hand-built body. There is no allow-list, no serializer and no
 * type standing between the column and a response.
 *
 * So the edit that falsifies the claim is not a new feature. It is one
 * character: a `.select("*")` on `scans` or `leads` puts `account_id` into the
 * row object, and both routes below are then one `...scan` away from
 * publishing it. That edit moves no type, fails no build and reads as a
 * simplification. Rule 1 is the one that catches it.
 *
 * ## What each rule is for
 *
 * 1. **Nothing selects `*`.** The mechanism above, stated once. Green today
 *    across the whole tree - measured, not assumed - and it is the cheapest
 *    way to lose the property.
 * 2. **The set of reads that bring `account_id` into memory is pinned, with a
 *    reason each.** Derived by walking `src` and resolving an identifier
 *    select back to the constant it names, so `.select(SCAN_UNLOCK_COLUMNS)`
 *    counts as a reader of every column that string contains. A fourth reader
 *    fails this file until somebody classifies it - the failure is meant to be
 *    a question, not a bug report.
 * 3. **The set of files that mention it at all is pinned.** Rule 2 sees
 *    database reads. A server component rendering `{scan.account_id}` is not a
 *    read, and a page is not a `Response.json` - so neither of the other rules
 *    would see the account view the comment warns about. This one does,
 *    because such a page has to name the column somewhere.
 * 4. **No row bound from one of those reads is ever spread.** The two routes
 *    name their own response fields today. `...scan` is the one-line edit that
 *    undoes that, and it is invisible to a reader who is looking at the select
 *    rather than at the response.
 * 5. **No response body anywhere in the tree names it.** Tree-wide rather than
 *    scoped to the two routes, for the reason `spend-gates` learned the hard
 *    way: a rule scoped to the files that have the property today cannot see
 *    the file that gains it tomorrow.
 *
 * ## What this cannot see, stated plainly
 *
 * A column reaching a visitor through a module the route imports for another
 * reason. `buildUnlockPayload` is the live instance of that shape - the unlock
 * response spreads `...payload` - and it is covered only because rule 2 walks
 * every select in the tree and that function's selects are not in the set. An
 * import is not a call, and this file does not build a call graph.
 *
 * Nothing here is a live defect. The tree is clean under all five rules and
 * each was proved against an injected instance before it was committed.

// ------------------------------------------------------------- the SQL half

/**
 * Same claim, same column, the other language.
 *
 * Rule 1 above says "nothing in this tree selects `*`" and walks `src` for
 * `.ts` and `.tsx`. The header calls that green "across the whole tree". It is
 * not the whole tree: **`scan_teaser` reads `from scans s`**, and `scans` is
 * the table `account_id` is a column of. Every rule above stops at the edge of
 * the `.sql` files, which is this repo's most-paid denominator failure - the
 * same edge `citations.test.mts` was standing on until `aadfd06`, and the same
 * shape as `spend-gates` claiming "every door in this tree" while walking
 * `src/app/api` for `route.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why the SQL side is the more exposed one, not the lesser one
 *
 * Measured off the migrations rather than remembered: of the six live
 * functions, **`scan_teaser` is the only one granted to `anon`**, and it is
 * `security definer`, so it runs with the owner's rights and ignores RLS. The
 * other five are `service_role` only and are reachable from this tree alone.
 * The grants themselves are held by `function-grants.test.mts`; what matters
 * here is the consequence - `scan_teaser` is the function behind the public
 * scan report, callable by anybody holding a public token, and it selects from
 * the account-bearing table.
 *
 * So the one-character edit rule 1 exists to refuse has an exact counterpart
 * here, and it is *cheaper* to make. The TypeScript version is
 * `.select("*")`. The SQL versions are two:
 *
 *  - `select c.*` inside one of the six `jsonb_agg(t)` sub-selects. Those
 *    aggregate a whole derived row by alias, so widening the sub-select's
 *    column list widens the published JSON with no other edit.
 *  - `to_jsonb(s)` or `row_to_json(s)` in place of the twenty-key
 *    `jsonb_build_object`. That reads as a simplification, shortens the
 *    function by ninety lines, and publishes every column of `scans` -
 *    `account_id`, `ip_hash` and `client_domain_id` included - to an
 *    anonymous caller.
 *
 * Neither fails a build, neither moves a TypeScript type, and rules 1 to 5
 * cannot see either.
 *
 * ## What these three rules are, and what they are not
 *
 * They are keyed on the shape of the query, the way the TypeScript rules are
 * keyed on the shape of the select. They cannot tell you a function is
 * *correct*; they refuse the two constructions that publish a column nobody
 * chose to publish, and they pin the denominator so the next function joins
 * loudly.
 *
 * `jsonb_agg(t)` is deliberately NOT forbidden. It is a whole-row
 * serialisation of a derived alias and the tree has six of them, every one
 * legitimate because the sub-select under it names its columns. Forbidding it
 * would fail on a clean tree, which is a rule written to be exempted rather
 * than heeded. The star rule below is what actually guards those six, and it
 * guards them at the only place the widening can happen.
 *
 * The star pattern is anchored at the column-list position - `select *` and
 * `select c.*`, never `count(*)`, which appears fourteen times in
 * `scan_teaser` alone and is not a whole-row read. That narrowing is the one
 * thing here most likely to be wrong in the flattering direction, so
 * `docs/inject-account-sql.mjs` proves it from both sides: a real `select c.*`
 * must be caught, and the existing `count(*)` must not be.
 */

/**
 * The tables a read of which can put the column, or the identity behind it, in
 * a function's hands.
 *
 * **Derived, because the first draft of this rule typed them.** That draft
 * listed `scans`, `leads`, `client_domains` and `accounts` from the four
 * `account_id` lines in front of whoever wrote it - which is the typed
 * denominator inside a sweep, the species this repo has paid for three times
 * in one sitting, arriving in the file written to close a denominator gap.
 * A table added tomorrow with an `account_id` on it would have been outside
 * it, and the rule would have stayed green while reporting on the tree.
 *
 * Two kinds of table qualify and the second is why `accounts` is here at all:
 * a table carrying the column, and the table the column points *at*, since
 * publishing `accounts.id` is the same disclosure spelled the other way.
