/**
 * A campaign reading can never be claimed, so the nightly purge takes its
 * prose - and `/coverage-check` used to promise the opposite.
 *
 * `reading.ts` states this in its own header, as the reason the reading page
 * deliberately renders no answer text: "a reading is never unlocked - it takes
 * no email, so nothing ever sets `unlocked_at`. Every reading's prose is
 * therefore gone a week after it was taken." That sentence is a claim about
 * three files none of which it can see, and nothing held any of it.
 *
 * ## What it cost
 *
 * `/coverage-check` told a visitor: "We ask the same engines a free scan reads
 * - ... - **keep the answers word for word**, and check every source they cite
 * against the coverage you upload."
 *
 * We do not keep them. A benchmark reading is a `scans` row with a
 * `campaign_id`; there is no email field, no unlock route and no verify link
 * on that path, so `completeUnlock` - the only writer of `unlocked_at` in the
 * tree - is unreachable from it. The purge then selects precisely
 * `unlocked_at is null` past `response_retention_days` and clears
 * `response_text`, with no campaign exclusion anywhere in the query. Seven
 * days after a reading, its prose is gone; and `reading.ts` never rendered a
 * word of it to begin with. The page promised something the visitor could
 * never read, on the one surface that then deletes it.
 *
 * That clause is gone (20 Sep 2026). **This file is not the fix - it is what
 * stops the sentence coming back while the facts under it still hold**, and
 * what makes the facts fail loudly if somebody changes them on purpose.
 * Whether a benchmark reading *should* be exempt from the purge is a retention
 * decision with a privacy-policy line attached, so it is blocked.md 30 rather
 * than mine.
 *
 * ## Why this is distinct from blocked.md 29
 *
 * 29 is the wording call over thirteen surfaces that say "verbatim" or "word
 * for word" about text that is assembled and stripped. There the claim is
 * generous and the words a reader saw do survive, which is why it is Danny's.
 * Here the claim was flatly false for this product, which is the case
 * `67bc96d` and `486d63a` both settled as takeable unattended: stop saying the
 * untrue thing, do not invent a new promise.
 *
 * ## Read from source, and why
 *
 * `purge-responses/route.ts` and `unlock.ts` both import `server-only` and
 * neither can be loaded under `node --test`. The properties here are about
 * which query is written and which module writes a column, not about a return
 * value, so a structural check is the honest instrument rather than a
 * second-best one - `constant-time.test.mts` records the same reasoning.
 * Comments are stripped first: every file involved discusses `unlocked_at` in
 * prose, and this file's own header quotes the query it is checking for.

/**
 * Every surface in the tree that promises the answer TEXT is kept, and whether

 *
 * ## Why this is not `verbatim-claims.test.mts`
 *
 * That file walks the same pages and asks a different question of them: is the
 * stored text *untouched* (blocked.md 29's wording call). It reads the word
 * `verbatim` and never reads the verb in front of it. **Whether the text is
 * KEPT is a second claim living inside the same sentence, and nothing walked
 * for it** - which is how /about's rule 2 sat beside /legal's "deleted after
 * seven days if nobody claims the scan" for as long as both were published.
 * Two files disagreeing about one fact, one of them a marketing page.
 *
 * ## The pattern, and why it is a pair rather than a word
 *
 * A keeping verb alone matches `could not store the answers` in a throw and
 * `the clusters you keep` on the homepage FAQ; an answer-text noun alone is
 * every line of `engines.ts`. The claim is the two together inside one
 * sentence, in either order - `[^.!?]` is the sentence bound, so a keeping
 * verb in one sentence and the noun in the next is not a promise.
 *
 * ## Read flattened, not line by line
 *
 * A per-line walk was written first and then asked what it could not see,
 * which is the refill this repo runs on its own sweeps. The answer was copy
 * concatenated across lines - `ResultView.tsx` writes its copy as one
 * concatenated string and `verbatim-claims` records that a single line there
 * can carry two claims. **Measured on 20 Sep 2026 the two walks agree at five,
 * so nothing is caught by the change today**; it is here because the direction
 * the per-line walk fails in is the flattering one, and a claim broken over
 * two lines to fit the formatter would have read as a clean tree.
 *
 * Comments are blanked first for the reason `verbatim-claims` needs the same
 * cut: this very header pairs "kept" with "the answers" several times.
