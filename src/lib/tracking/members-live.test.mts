/**
 * Live-member census (R141, Danny, 30 Sep 2026, danny.md 134-136; BRIEF-4 P0).
 *
 * Removing a member never deletes the row: it sets `removed_at`. So every
 * read of `dashboard_members` - the page 404, API role checks, `clientsFor`,
 * the login link, the admin list - and every update must carry
 * `.is("removed_at", null)`, or a removed member keeps their access. A
 * `.delete()` on the table is refused outright. Upserts are writes that make
 * or revive a member and need no filter.
 *
 * Extended 9 Oct 2026 (AG-1, audit security-2, launch blocker LB2) to the
 * member's client scope, `dashboard_member_clients` (scope.ts):
 *
 * - the same removed_at rule on that table - a removed scope row still
 *   limiting, or still granting, is the same defect;
 * - every read of dashboard_members that decides who sees a client applies
 *   the scope, and every other read is recorded here with why it need not.
 *   A read that skips the scope shows a member limited to one client every
 *   client on the account, which is the defect the table exists to end.

 * invite's upsert that revives a removed row.
 *
 * Moved 9 Oct 2026 (AG-1) to what the walk finds, 16 and 14: since the floor
 * was set, the runner's first_reading and lifecycle-sweep's two owner reads
 * (1 and 8 Oct), the admin create's owner upsert and Settings' team read were
 * already there unfloored; and two upserts now hand back their row's id with
 * .select (team.ts writeMember, the admin's setMember add), which the filter
 * below counts. The scope table's own: 4 calls - readScopes, addScope,
 * dropScope, clearScope - 3 of them reads or updates.
 *
 * Moved 9 Oct 2026 (AG-1 review) to 17 and 15: an invite to someone already
 * on the account for other clients sets their role with an update that
 * requires removed_at is null (team.ts keepRow), where it used to revive the
