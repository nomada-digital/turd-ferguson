/**
 * Re-running a day's failed reads (9 Oct 2026, audit reliability-4).
 *
 * Before this a failed, partial or killed run could never be read again: "Run
 * now" refused anything not queued, the runner's claim moves only queued to
 * running, and (client, run_date) is unique. Pilot history says retryable
 * failure is common - 10 of 22 runs from 30 Sep to 8 Oct finished partial,
 * most on google_aio (verifier read, 8 Oct 2026) - and a day not read is a day the dashboard can never
 * show.
 *
 * So "Run now" on today's failed, partial or stalled run asks for a re-run
 * (askRerun) and dispatches it down the same signed path as the cron. The
 * runner claims it (claimRerun) under the same tracking_enabled switch and
 * daily cost cap, and reads again only what did not come back:
 *
 * - an answer with no row, or one that came back unanswered, is asked of the
 *   engine again (retryAnswers); so is a keyword with no position stored
 *   (retryKeywords);
 * - an answer that came back but whose other brands were not read has only
 *   its brands read again, from the text stored, by the same one extraction
 *   per engine (rebrandAnswers) - the engine is not asked again, and the
 *   row's text, named and citations stay as they were read;
 * - everything else is left as it was read.
 *
 * Unanswered includes a SERP with no AI Overview, which is a silence and not
 * a failure. The rows cannot tell the two apart - a failed read is stored
 * answered=false with no text, as a silence is - so a re-run asks both again
 * rather than guess, and a re-read that fails leaves the row it found in
 * place (keepsOld) and counts as a failed read. That over-counts, never
 * under-counts: the error line never calls a read good that was not re-read.
 *
 * Only today's run. A reading is dated by its run's run_date, and a read made
 * tomorrow stored under today would be a backfill the dashboard cannot tell
 * from a reading.
 *
 * A re-run never leaves the day worse than it found it, by construction
 * (review of b2e0019, 9 Oct 2026). The ask and the claim move nothing a
 * reader reads: a failed or partial run keeps its status, error line and
 * finished_at, so the client's Overview, the run notes, the health JSON and
 * the stall sweep see the run exactly as before, while it is asked, while it
 * reads, and for good if it is never claimed or is killed. Only the pass's
 * own close writes them, from what the day's rows now hold. A re-run the cap
 * refuses or that throws closes without touching them (restored). The ask
 * lives in a marker in step_ms (nothing else reads tracking_runs.step_ms),
 * which also holds whether an earlier pass of the run landed, so
 * first_reading - sent after a client's first run that did not fail - is not
 * sent twice for one day.
 *
 * Loadable by node --test: relative imports, no server-only, the database
 * passed in (rerun.test.mts runs it against an in-memory one).
