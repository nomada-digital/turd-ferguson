/**
 * Team on Settings - R142 part 2 (1 Oct 2026; BRIEF-4 P2 "2. Team"). Owners
 * invite, change a role and remove; editors and viewers only read the list.
 *
 * Removing never deletes: it sets `removed_at` and `removed_by`, and every
 * membership read requires `removed_at is null`, so the removed email's next
 * request 404s. A removed member is re-invited on the same row by clearing
 * `removed_at` (`unique (account_id, email)` holds). Owners are made in
 * /admin/tracking only; no one changes or removes themselves, and the last
 * owner can be neither demoted nor removed.
 *
 * Caps: 10 live members who see a client, 20 invites per owner per day,
 * counted off `dashboard_events` rows with event `member_invite`.
 *
 * Per-client scope (AG-1, audit security-2; 9 Oct 2026, scope.ts): Settings
 * lists, counts and changes only the members who see the client it is on.
 * Every invite is to this client only unless the owner picks every client,
 * which the form offers on an account with two or more; a member limited to
 * some clients loses only this one on Remove, and the member goes when it was
 * their last. A member keeps one role on the account, so an invite or a role
 * change on one client sets the role they have on all of theirs.
 *
 * Pure rules first so the tests run each one - planTeam is all of them, in
 * the member route's order - and the writers are the network half.
