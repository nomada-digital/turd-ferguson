/**
 * Re-running a day's failed reads (9 Oct 2026, audit reliability-4).
 *
 * A failed, partial or killed run could never be read again: "Run now"
 * refused anything not queued and the claim moves only queued to running.
 * These hold the ask and the claim (compare-and-swaps that never take a run
 * still reading), what a re-run asks again, what it reads again from the text
 * stored, what it leaves alone, and that it never leaves the day worse than
 * it found it - against an in-memory database (fake-db.mts), nothing real
 * read or written.
 *
 * Review of b2e0019 (9 Oct 2026): the first version moved the run back to
 * queued before dispatching it. For the minutes a re-run read, the client's
 * Overview lost the partial day; a dispatch that failed, a re-run never
 * claimed or one the platform killed left the day queued, or failed by the
 * stall sweep, for good; and the health JSON turned 503. The ask now writes
 * only a marker, so the tests below read the run as each reader reads it at
 * every step - asked, claimed, never claimed, killed - and find it as it was.
