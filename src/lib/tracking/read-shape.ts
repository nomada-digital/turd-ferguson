 * What each dashboard page reads, and no more (8 Oct 2026, audit perf-4,
 * perf-9 and perf-1). No I/O of its own - readAnswers runs on whatever table
 * it is handed - so the fixture repo shapes its copy with the same plan as
 * the Supabase read, and node --test can run both.
 *
 * Every page used to read every answer of the range with its `brands` and
 * `citations` jsonb - most of each row's bytes, citation titles included -
 * whether or not it drew them:
 *
 * - Settings and Setup draw only the clusters, prompts and keywords, so they
 *   read the structure and no answer at all (`loadStructure`).
 * - The keywords CSV is tracking_serp's rows only (`answers: "none"`).
 * - Reports' monthly cards read verdicts only (`"verdicts"`): monthFigures
 *   takes the named rate, like-for-like, prompts named and page 1, none of
 *   which reads a brand or a citation. read-shape.test.mts holds every card
 *   equal on full and verdict-only rows, on every fixture state.
 * - Placements reads the picked cluster's prompts with their citations, no
 *   brands (`"cites"`, `cluster`); the one-cluster page reads its own
 *   prompts, every column (`cluster`). Both are held equal to the full read.
 * - Overview, Who is named, Cited pages and Clusters read everything. The
 *   audit had Clusters as using neither jsonb column; it does - the
 *   never-named upgrade prompt names the hosts cited for those prompts
 *   (upgrade-facts.ts neverNamedFacts) - so it is left whole.
 *
 * A column left out comes back as an empty list, not as a missing field, so
 * every figure type still holds. That is also how a page that starts to need
 * a column it does not ask for would fail: silently, as zero. So the pages on
 * a narrow read are named in read-shape.test.mts with the figures they draw,
 * and a new use of their answers fails the census there.
