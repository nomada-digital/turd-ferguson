/**
 * Response headers.
 *
 * The site was serving none of these. HSTS comes from Vercel; everything
 * below had to be asked for.
 *
 * The one that is not boilerplate is the X-Robots-Tag on /api and /scan.
 * robots.txt now closes both to crawlers, but robots.txt governs fetching and
 * says nothing to anything that has already fetched. The scan pages carry a
 * noindex meta tag; the JSON under /api returns the same brand, domain and
 * placement data and cannot carry a meta tag at all, because it is not HTML.
 * The header is the only form of the directive that reaches it.
 *
 * `:path+` on /scan, not `:path*`. The docs for this version are explicit that
 * `*` is zero or more and that `/blog/:slug*` matches `/blog`, so `/scan`
 * itself was picking up the header. What is protected is a scan result, which
 * always has a token under it, so "one or more segments" is the rule that was
 * meant. /api keeps `*`: there is no page at bare /api, so the extra match
 * costs nothing and a 404 is better off noindexed anyway.
 *
 * CORRECTION, 19 Sep, read off the live page rather than the headers. The
 * commit that made this change (7541ba2) said it was un-indexing /scan and
 * that src/app/robots.ts wanted /scan indexable. Neither is so, and the check
 * behind it only read response headers.
 *
 * robots.ts keeps /scan *crawlable*, which is not the same thing, and its own
 * sentence says why - "a linked URL that is closed gets listed as a bare
 * address, which is worse than the noindex it already carries". It is the
 * action of seven `<form method="get">` across the site, so it must be
 * fetchable; it carries `noindex, nofollow` in its own page metadata, and
 * still does today. Crawlable plus noindex is the pairing that was intended
 * and the one that is live: the crawler fetches it, reads the tag, and does
 * not list the bare URL.
 *
 * So this rule change removed a header that duplicated a meta tag, and /scan
 * is not and was never made indexable by it. That is the right outcome - the
 * page renders the home page's hero with the domain field prefilled, carries
 * `?domain=` and `?verify=` state, has no description of its own and is
 * deliberately absent from sitemap.ts. Indexing it would put a near-duplicate
 * of the home page into the index against the home page's own canonical.

/**
 * Content-Security-Policy.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BUYS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT, because a CSP is easy to overstate.
 *
 * script-src keeps 'unsafe-inline'. This policy therefore does NOT stop an
 * injected inline script. It is not XSS protection and must not be described
 * as such in a commit message or to a customer.
 *
 * That is forced by Next's own output rather than chosen. A statically
 * generated page in this app carries four inline script tags with no
 * integrity attribute, one of them the RSC flight payload
 * (self.__next_f.push) - checked in .next/server/app/*.html, not assumed.
 * Dropping 'unsafe-inline' therefore needs a per-request nonce or a hash.
 *
 * The nonce is the documented route and it costs more here than it returns:
 * the Next docs are explicit that a nonce forces every page to render
 * dynamically, which for the static marketing pages means no CDN caching and
 * a server render per view. (Counted here as 21 when this was written; the
 * build says 20 today, because /blog reads searchParams for its filter pills
 * and buys a per-request render with it. Stated as "the static pages" rather
 * than as a number, because the number moves and nothing depends on it.) It
 * would be buying that against an injection
 * vector the site does not currently have - every dangerouslySetInnerHTML
 * here is JSON-LD built from static config, none of it from a crawled site
 * or from a visitor.
 *
 * What it does buy are the four directives that need no nonce and cannot
 * break a render:
 *   base-uri 'self'    an injected <base> cannot re-point every relative URL
 *   form-action        an injected form cannot post the contact form or a
 *                      scan email address to someone else. 'self' plus
 *                      Stripe's two hosted pages, because Chrome enforces
 *                      form-action on the redirect a form submission
 *                      follows: /checkout's form posts to /api/checkout,
 *                      which 303s to checkout.stripe.com, and with 'self'
 *                      alone the browser blocked "Continue to payment"
 *                      (R155, severity 1, Danny, 1 Oct 2026, danny.md line
 *                      155). billing.stripe.com is the billing portal's
 *                      host, named in the same fix. Navigation targets, not
 *                      subresources - nothing is fetched from them by a page
 *                      here - so the third-party censuses read them apart
 *                      (FORM_TARGETS in src/app/privacy-claims.test.mts).
 *   object-src 'none'  no plugin-embedded script
 *   frame-ancestors    clickjacking, and the directive browsers honour in
 *                      preference to the X-Frame-Options above
 *
 * When the inline-script hole is worth closing, the upgrade is SRI
 * (experimental.sri), not a nonce, because it keeps static rendering. It
 * hashes files and not inline scripts, so it does not close this on its own
 * today.
 *
 * challenges.cloudflare.com is Turnstile on the scan form - its script and
 * the widget's iframe. It is the site's only third-party origin.

   * real rule added and watching the hash move, after a first attempt with
   * only a comment proved nothing because the minifier strips those.
   *
   * Cost of turning it off: assets carry ?dpl= again and a returning visitor
   * re-downloads them after each deploy. On a site with almost no traffic that
   * is not a cost. Getting the stylesheet you just shipped is not optional.
